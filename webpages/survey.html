        <h1>winLAME Survey Results</h1>

        <p>
            In the winLAME 2018 beta version, the users of winLAME have the opportunity to fill
            out a small survey to give feedback. This was done using the two "Send a Smile" and
            "Send a Frown" smiley buttons in the winLAME menu band or the toolbar. The two feedback
            forms are also available using the website links.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that you can always take the survey using these two links:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="feedback_positive.html">Send a Smile</a></li>
                <li><a href="feedback_negative.html">Send a Frown</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Survey Results - winLAME 2018 beta 1</h1>

        <p>
            Here are the collected responses from the feedback survey in the "2018 beta 1"
            time frame.
        </p>

        <h2>Send a Frown - 1 answer</h2>

        <p>Let's start with the frowns first. The following three questions were asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you not like about winLAME? What made you frown?</li>
            <li>What should be fixed so that winLAME would get better?</li>
            <li>What audio formats do you use mostly (not only in winLAME)?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only the answer to the first question was mandatory. There was only one answer this
            year. I show the results of the third question below, in the "Send a Smile" section.
        </p>

        <p>
            The respondent asked for the old style User Interface that is still available in
            winLAME, but maybe a bit hidden. The Classic UI mode only shows the wizard pages and
            does the encoding and CD reading on the last page.
        </p>

        <h2>Send a Smile - 13 answers</h2>

        <p>Now to the positive feedback. The following throw questions were asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you like about winLAME? What made you smile?</li>
            <li>What feature would you like in winLAME to make it even better?</li>
            <li>What audio formats do you use mostly (not only in winLAME)?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only the answer to the first question was mandatory. There were 13 answers, which are
            summarized here.
        </p>

        <p>
            These answers again reflect on the maturity of winLAME throughout all the years it
            exists:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>simple and easy to use</li>
            <li>encoding presets</li>
            <li>best MP3 encoder</li>
            <li>multi-CPU encoding</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There were some feature requests again in this year's survey results:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>get song and artist name automatically</li>
            <li>using winLAME from the explorer search</li>
            <li>themes</li>
            <li>other languages</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Note that you can participate in the development of winLAME by helping out coding
            features or translating winLAME in your native language. Check out the source code
            or contact me - see more details on the <a href="developmeht.html">Development</a>
            page.
        </p>

        <h2>Audio formats - 12 answers</h2>

        <p>
            Both feedback forms had optional multi-selection checkboxes to select the used audio
            file formats. The question posted was: "What audio formats do you use mostly (not only
            in winLAME)?". 12 of the 14 respondents gave an answer to this question.
        </p>

        <img src="images/survey-results-2018.png" title="Survey Results 2018" alt="Survey Results 2018" />

        <p>
            Unsurprisingly MP3 is the format used by all respondents - winLAME is known for its
            integration of <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">LAME mp3 encoder</a>. Other
            formats are represented less. What surprised me most is that no user is using Opus.
            Nevertheless the poll may have insufficient samples to be of significance.
        </p>

        <h1>Survey Results - winLAME 2017 beta 2 and beta 3</h1>

        <p>
            Here are the collected responses from the feedback survey in the "2017 beta 2" and
            "2017 beta 3" time frame.
        </p>

        <h2>Send a Frown - 12 answers</h2>

        <p>Let's start with the frowns first. The following two questions were asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you not like about winLAME? What made you frown?</li>
            <li>What should be fixed so that winLAME would get better?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only the answer to the first question was mandatory. This time, there was a notice
            below the survey, that bugs shouldn't be reported using this form, but instead the bug
            tracker or a personal mail sent to me should be used. There were 12 answers, which are
            summarized and abbreviated here. Some answers were double or were variations of other
            answers and were left out from the list.
        </p>

        <p>First, there still were some bugs reported using the form:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>no audio in output files</li>
            <li>crashing/crashing during ripping</li>
            <li>can see through the program window to the desktop</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Unfortunately I can't do much about these bugs, as I can't reach out to the specific
            user, as the survey is completely anonymous. Please, write at least an e-mail to me,
            in order to get these bugs fixed!
        </p>

        <p>
            Then there were some missing features reported using the "Frown" feedback form:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Not removing WAV files after CD reading</li>
            <li>M4A AAC support - "Channel coupling not yet implemented"</li>
            <li>specify parameters for LAME</li>
            <li>not recognizing .aif extension, only .aiff</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Some of these features can certainly be done easily, and I will consider them for the
            winLAME 2018 version. The M4A AAC support is a little bit more complicated, since
            another encoder library has to be integrated into winLAME. The solution may be to
            integrate ffmpeg, since it supports many audio formats. Ths also would be a possible
            feature for winLAME 2018.
        </p>

        <p>
            One miscellaneous issue was reported that came up twice:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>output location read-only</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The output location is only read-only when the check box "Use input file's folder as
            output location" is checked. It should now be obvious where the files are going to be
            written.
        </p>

        <h2>Send a Smile - 29 answers</h2>

        <p>Now to the positive feedback. The following two questions were asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you like about winLAME? What made you smile?</li>
            <li>What feature would you like in winLAME to make it even better?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only the answer to the first question was mandatory. There were 29 answers, which are
            summarized here.
        </p>

        <p>These answers are given very often and reflect on the maturity of the application:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>nice user interface</li>
            <li>easy and fast</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Most feature requests come from the Smile feedback form, also this time:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>right-click explorer context menu integration</li>
            <li>reverse encoding process: First specify settings, then drag-n-drop files</li>
            <li>saving of window layout / size after restarting the program</li>
            <li>create custom encoding settings and save a profile</li>
            <li>edit presets</li>
            <li>not all options are remembered (e.g. constant bitrate)</li>
            <li>auto-create directory structure</li>
            <li>module support comparable with mod, s3m xm or it</li>
            <li>more expert settings</li>
            <li>add Opus 512 kbps as preset</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Some of these requests are also considered for winLAME 2018. Especially the wish for
            extending the presets stand out. These can already accomplished today, the provided
            preset.xml file can be extended with new presets, and a detailed explanation is
            contained in the winLAME F1 help file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then there were some features that are already available in winLAME, but some users
            couldn't find them:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>avoid adding album and artist to filename</li>
            <li>create FLAC files</li>
            <li>convert FLAC of 24 bits to 16 bits or 8 bits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The first item, the filename template for ripped files, can be adjusted in the "CD
            Read Settings" page. The way to create FLAC files (in sample sizes of 8/16/24 bits)
            is to select the "libSndFile Audio Output" module and either select the FLAC 16 bit
            preset, or select "Custom settings" and set the File Format to "FLAC". The Sample
            Format can be adjusted at will.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally there were some miscellaneous comments:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>enable / disable joint stereo</li>
            <li>couldn't figure out how to use it with MusicBee</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Joint Stereo / Stereo question is probably as old as the MP3 format itself. On the
            old winLAME home page there was an
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404222252/http://winlame.sourceforge.net/faq.php">FAQ section</a>
            with exactly that question. I back then asked one of the LAME team members if the
            stereo mode should be made available in the UI again. Here's what Gabriel Bouvigne
            answered:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
            <cite>
                I would strongly advise you to NOT provide this kind of choice to the end user.
                Activating legacy stereo instead of joint stereo will decrease quality in 99% of the
                cases. Lame is internally able to switch between LR stereo and MS stereo on a frame
                basis, trying to use the most efficient mode on each frame. On usual signals, using LR
                instead of MS is quite inneficient, using more bits. When there are not enough
                available bits to stay at the transparency threshold, we must decrease quality. This
                situation is more likely to appear in legacy stereo mode.
            </cite>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
            <cite>
                I think that most users only want this because of placebo effect. They feel better if
                they can change default options, and because of this they are convinced (without blind
                tests, of course) that the results are better. If we never offered the option, users
                would probably not mind, but now that we provided the choice in the past, they want
                it. Most AAC encoders (Apple, Nero) are not offering the choice, and are using MS or
                LR at their own convenience when the user is encoding a stereo track, and no one is
                complaining about it, mainly because those encoders never offered any other choice.
            </cite>
        </p>

        <p>
            What the MusicBee user wanted is probably to integrate the LAME encoder into the media
            player.
        </p>

        <h1>Survey Results - winLAME 2017 beta 1</h1>

        <p>
            Here are the collected responses from the feedback survey in the "2017 beta 1" time
            frame.
        </p>


        <h2>Send a Frown - 37 answers</h2>

        <p>Let's start with the frowns first. The following two questions were asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you not like about winLAME? What made you frown?</li>
            <li>What should be fixed so that winLAME would get better?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only the answer to the first question was mandatory. There were 37 answers, which are
            summarized and abbreviated here. Some answers were double or were variations of other
            answers and were left out from the list.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>empty output file</li>
            <li>crashing all the time</li>
            <li>unexplainable error</li>
            <li>converting multiple files laggy UI, CPU</li>
            <li>crash FLAC to MP3 v0 encoding</li>
            <li>encoded files too short</li>
            <li>crash on input files</li>
            <li>artist and title mixed up</li>
            <li>repeated encoding infinitely</li>
            <li>"encoding finished" action doesn't work</li>
            <li>portable version crashed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There were some serious bugs reported using the survey form. Unfortunately this form
            is not the best way to report bugs, and so in the meantime I added a sentence below
            the survey to report bugs in other ways. When fixing bugs I often need more
            information, e.g. a crash dump file, or I let the user try another build of the
            winLAME.exe if the bug is gone. Nevertheless I tried to reproduce the errors and come
            up with a fix for these bugs.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>crop feature wish</li>
            <li>doesn't save settings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There were some feature wishes also. The first, to offer cropping (MP3) files would be
            an interesting feature, but unfortunately adding audio file editing is outside of the
            scope of what winLAME should or could do. The "doesn't save settings" is a valid point.
            Nowadays settings that one has adjusted should be saved immediately - I often stumble
            over this myself during debugging winLAME.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>new interface ugly</li>
            <li>ugly icons</li>
            <li>UI decals more HD</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These are some points that deal with the new user interface and with the icons used.
            The new user interface is different, in that it presents you the list of tasks that
            are worked on, which is necessary now that winLAME does parallel encoding. The way of
            setting up encoding with a wizard (which I guess is winLAME's reason for success) is
            still used, both in Modern UI and in Classic UI mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm using some stock icons

            set, in fact) in winLAME. I'm not an artist, so I can't design new icons (that would
            look even uglier), so if you are a graphics designer and/or you want to provide better
            icons, <a href="development.html">get in touch with me</a>!

        <h2>Send a Smile - 70 answers</h2>

        <p>Now to the positive feedback. The following two questions were asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you like about winLAME? What made you smile?</li>
            <li>What feature would you like in winLAME to make it even better?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only the answer to the first question was mandatory. There were 70 answers, which are
            summarized here.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>easy to use interface</li>
            <li>fast conversion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These two points were given often. The easy to use UI was always the strength of
            winLAME. My guess is because the wizard approach doesn't shove all of the options in
            your face at once, and still give you the feeling you're in control. The fast
            conversion is natural nowadays, with CPU's much faster than 17 years ago when winLAME
            started.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>modify frequencies</li>
            <li>audio CD write</li>
            <li>edit ID3 after encoding</li>
            <li>m4a support</li>
            <li>Japanese music db to get album info</li>
            <li>multiple output modules at once</li>
            <li>choose internet addresses for files</li>
            <li>better UI for selecting output audio quality</li>
            <li>integrate audio editor</li>
            <li>CD error checking, correction</li>
            <li>converting of DSD files</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There were some big feature requests in the answers. These are all great, but they
            have a downside - someone has to code them. As I'm working on winLAME only from time
            to time, these features most probably won't get worked on. Remember that coding the
            new Modern UI together with the multithreaded encoding took me about 7 years, working
            at it on and off. Nevertheless, winLAME is Open Source, and if you have some C++
            coding skills, you could tacke one of the features and try to develop them.
            <a href="development.html">Contact me</a> if you have questions during coding, or
            hack on your feature right away. Note that winLAME is using the GPL license.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>all buttons labeled - for screen readers</li>
            <li>changeable font size</li>
            <li>shell integration</li>
            <li>settings how much cores</li>
            <li>two digit numbering when CDs have &gt; 9 tracks</li>
            <li>recurse directories</li>
            <li>folder for artist, then album folder</li>
            <li>CD eject button</li>
            <li>ReplayGain for Opus files</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These are some minor features or things that were requested. They might or might not
            get into the next "2017 beta 3" version of winLAME. As above, if you are a coder, you
            may implement these features yourself.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>preset 320 mp3 high quality</li>
            <li>FLAC tag reading</li>
            <li>Linux version</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There are so many features in winLAME that sometimes a feature is already built into
            winLAME without the user noticing. I improved the winLAME Help File and updated all
            pages, so if in doubt about an option or feature in winLAME, press F1 and start
            reading. About the features mentioned in the survey: The requested LAME preset is
            already there, it's called "Archiving: Best Quality". FLAC tags also should be read
            already. If there's anything missing, <a href="development.html">report a bug</a> or
            <a href="development.html">contact me</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            About the Linux version... there's a package called Wine that emulates Windows on
            Linux. Starting from Wine-2.0 it can also run winLAME without problems. I used the
            winLAME setup package on Ubuntu 16.04 to test this. Ubuntu has the package "Play on
            Linux" which sits on top of Wine which makes installing winLAME possible even for
            non-hackers. I may post an article in the future about how to install and use winLAME
            on Linux.
