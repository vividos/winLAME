            <h1>History</h1>

            <p>
                For all interested in how winLAME came to be, here's a little story.
            </p>

            <h2>The early years (2000-2001)</h2>

            <p>
                winLAME started in the year 2000 when I was programming User
                Interfaces at a small company, during semester breaks. I had only
                two weeks left to work when the company was closed down due to the
                dot com bubble burst. My team lead said "You get paid for the
                remaining time, but you don't have to actually program anymore".
            </p>

            <p>
                The idea to do winLAME came from experimenting with LAME. I had a
                small Linux server at home where I managed to compile LAME and
                encode Wave files to MP3. I thought, why not doing a Windows
                version with a neat User Interface. Together with the free time
                at work, I started coding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since LAME was an Open Source project, I also started winLAME as
                one, using the SourceForge services, which were very helpful at
                the time. The project was registered in February 2001, code was
                stored in CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and I did a small
                website to download the first versions:
            </p>

            <h2>The productive years (2001-2010)</h2>

            <p>
                The next years I was rather active on the project,
                experimenting with user interfaces and source code. I did
                several releases of the software, in the "release early,
                release often" style. I also got positive feedback from single
                enthusiastic users. The wizard style of the user interface was
                praised the most. I was also fascinated how many downloads the
                software packages had, which was about 800 dowloads/week, at
                peak times.
            </p>

            <p>
                During these years LAME was updated very often. It had many
                obscure switches and was complicated to use. winLAME also used
                the same switches. The LAME team realized that presets would
                be easier for the average user to grasp, and so the
                "alt-presets" were introduced. I changed winLAME also, to only
                offer LAME options they could understand. After all, winLAME
                should be a tool for the normal user.
            </p>

            <p>
                winLAME also incorporated other audio libraries, e.g. Ogg
                Vorbis or LibSndFile, which supported many audio input
                formats. Other programmers also worked on winLAME, e.g. a CD
                reading module from DeXT, a Monkey's Audio decoding module
                from Kjetil Haga or optimized LAME DLLs from John33.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2006 work on winLAME slowed down quite a bit. I did some
                releases in 2009 and 2010, but I considered winLAME as
                "mature" and complete.
            </p>

            <h2>The lazy years (2011-2016)</h2>

            <p>
                New ideas about user interface design sometimes came up, and
                I thought about reviving winLAME. I wanted to use multiple CPU
                cores, which now were a common thing. In 2012 I moved the
                source code from CVS to Git and started to refactor code,
                generally clean up the project and trying out some things.
                I implemented a ribbon style main window (ribbons were
                introduced in Office 2007) and began writing a task manager
                that manages running multiple encoder tasks in parallel.
                Development on the new version stalled again, and I didn't
                release a new version.
            </p>

            <h2>Now and the future (2016-2017)</h2>

            <p>
                In late 2016 I wanted to finally finish the winLAME project
                that accompanied me for the last 16 years. I first updated all
                the audio encoding and decoding libraries and realized that
                there wasn't a lot of movement in the audio encoding scene in
                the last years. LAME development has stalled, and the only new
                encoders were Speex (which was already obsolete again) and
                Opus.
            </p>

            <p>
                I finished the parallel encoding task manager and the new
                ribbon interface and made many improvements under the hood. I
                decided to keep the wizard dialogs as "Classic UI", so that
                veteran users could switch to their known user interface.
                There are also presets for all encoders, not just LAME. I even
                cleaned up the winLAME help file, since one user wrote that he
                finds it very informational.
            </p>

            <p>
                So now we are here in the present. I decided to do some "beta"
                releases in order to give the users something to try out, and
                to gather more feedback. Once the users (and me) are
                satisfied, I'd do a "winLAME 2017 Release" version and be done
                with it. But who knows how long winLAME will be maintained?
                After all, it exists for 17 years already!
            </p>
